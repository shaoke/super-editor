# super-editor


This project is stopped for temp, the reason is Chrome Package App has too many restrict, if I want to change it to Chrome Package App, I need to change to many code, and as a beginner of StackEdit, I don't think it is a good way to get start, so I will stop it now. And make it a chrome hosted app
